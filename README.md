# Project Overview

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

The task was for us to finish the original developer's test suite.

Per the project's specifications, I completed the test suite.

Most of the new features can be found in the 'feedreader.js' file. I also edited 'app.js' file for a few of the tests to work.
