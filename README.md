# Project Overview

This Udacity project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

The task was for us to finish the original developer's test suite.

Per the project's specifications, I completed the test suite.

Most of the new features can be found in the 'feedreader.js' file. I also edited 'app.js' file for a few of the tests to work.

# Instructions

Open the "index.html" to launch the application. The bottom of the screen will display the test results from "feedreader.js" (test file is located in the 'spec' folder).
