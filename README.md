# Project Overview

This Udacity project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

The task was for us to finish the original developer's test suite.

Per the project's specifications, I completed the test suite.

All the work I've done can be found in the "feedreader.js" file.

# Instructions

Open the "index.html" to launch the application. The bottom of the screen will display the test results from "feedreader.js" (test file is located in the 'spec' folder).
